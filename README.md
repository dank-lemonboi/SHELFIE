This Project was a re-creation of a simple organization app created by the instructors at dev mountain. It was a great exercize which tought basic principles of passing props in react, rendering dynamically through the URL, passing data from from to back, re-rendering componets based on state change due to user inputs, and the basics of CRUD.

Simple functionality, simple styling.
